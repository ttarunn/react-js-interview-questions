#### 4. What are pseudo-classes in CSS?  
**Answer**:  
Pseudo-classes define a special state of an element. Common examples:  
- `:hover`: Styles an element when hovered over.  
- `:nth-child(n)`: Selects the nth child of a parent.  
- `:focus`: Styles an element when it gains focus.

input:focus { border: 1px solid blue; }  
```

#### 5. What is the difference between `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning?  
**Answer**:  
1. **Relative**: Positions the element relative to its normal position.  
2. **Absolute**: Positions the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or `<html>` if none).  
3. **Fixed**: Positions the element relative to the viewport, and it doesn’t move when scrolling.  
4. **Sticky**: Toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.  

Example:  
```css  
position: relative;  
top: 10px;  
```

#### 6. What is the difference between `em` and `rem` in CSS?  
**Answer**:  
- **`em`**: Relative to the font size of its parent.  
- **`rem`**: Relative to the root element's font size.  

Example:  
```css  
font-size: 2em; /* Twice the size of the parent */  
font-size: 2rem; /* Twice the size of the root (usually 16px) */  
```

#### 7. What are CSS selectors?  
**Answer**:  
CSS selectors are patterns used to select elements to style. Examples:

- **Class Selector**: `.class { }`  
- **ID Selector**: `#id { }`

#### 8. What is the difference between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` elements?  
**Answer**:  
- **Inline**: Takes up only as much width as necessary and doesn’t start a new line (e.g., `<span>`).  
- **Block**: Takes up the full width and starts on a new line (e.g., `<div>`).  
- **Inline-block**: Behaves like an inline element but allows block-level styling (e.g., width and height).  

---

#### 9. How do you apply styles to specific child elements?  
**Answer**:  
Use **child combinators** or pseudo-classes. Examples:  
```css  
/* Direct child */  
div > p { color: red; }  

/* nth child */  
li:nth-child(2) { color: blue; }  
```

#### 10. What are media queries in CSS?  
**Answer**:

}

div { z-index: 10; position: relative; }

- `max-width`: Ensures the element does not exceed the specified width.

#### 18. How does `float` work in CSS?  
**Answer**:

img { float: left; }

### 1. What is React?  
**Answer**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to develop and maintain complex web applications. React was developed by Facebook and is widely used due to its efficiency and flexibility.  

---

### 2. What is a component in React?  
**Answer**: A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI in a React application. Components can be functional or class-based and can manage their own state. Components allow for modularity and help organize code, making it more readable and maintainable.  

---

### 3. What is the Virtual DOM?  
**Answer**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering. When a componentâ€™s state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then compares it with the actual DOM (using a process called "diffing"). React then updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, which improves performance.  

---

### 4. What is state in React?  
**Answer**: State is an object in React components that holds data or information about the component. When the state of a component changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new data. State is mutable and managed within the component.  

---

### 5. What are props in React?  
**Answer**: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable and allow components to be dynamic and reusable.  

---

### 6. What is Redux?  
**Answer**: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store for managing application state, making it easier to debug and predict state changes. Redux uses actions, reducers, and a store to handle state updates.  

---

### 7. What is Context API?  
**Answer**: The Context API is a React feature that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It's used for managing global state in React applications and is often an alternative to Redux for simpler state management needs.  

---

### 8. What is JSX in React?  
**Answer**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it needs to be transpiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel.  

---

### 9. What is the difference between functional and class components in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **Functional Components**: JavaScript functions that return JSX. They use React Hooks for state and lifecycle management.  
- **Class Components**: ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`, with lifecycle methods and a `render` method for JSX.  

Functional components are preferred for their simplicity and performance benefits.  

---

### 10. What is `useEffect` in React?  
**Answer**: `useEffect` is a React Hook that allows functional components to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run only when specific dependencies change.  

---

### 11. How do you optimize React app performance?  
**Answer**:  
- Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components.  
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values.  
- Split code using dynamic imports or lazy loading (`React.lazy`).  
- Avoid unnecessary state updates.  
- Use proper keys in lists for rendering.  

---

### 12. What is React Router?  
**Answer**: React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It provides components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, and `Link` to create dynamic and single-page routing.  

---

### 13. What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?  
**Answer**:  
- **`useCallback`**: Memoizes a function and returns the same instance unless its dependencies change.  
- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes the result of a computation and recalculates it only if its dependencies change.  

---

### 14. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?  
**Answer**: A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component. HOCs are used for reusing logic and behavior between components.  

---

### 15. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **Controlled Components**: Components where form data is handled by React state. Example: `<input value={state} onChange={handleChange} />`  
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Components where form data is handled by the DOM. Example: `<input ref={inputRef} />`  

---

### 16. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **localStorage**: Data persists even after the browser is closed.  
- **sessionStorage**: Data persists only during the session and is cleared when the browser is closed.  

---

### 17. What is Next.js, and how is it different from React?  
**Answer**: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features out of the box. While React is a library for building UI, Next.js is used to build full-fledged React applications with routing, APIs, and performance optimizations.  

---

### 18. How do you handle forms in React?  
**Answer**:  
- Use controlled components with state to manage input values.  
- Use `onChange` handlers to update state.  
- Libraries like Formik or React Hook Form can simplify form handling and validation.  

---

### 19. What is React.memo?  
**Answer**: `React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components by memoizing them. It renders the component only if its props have changed.  

---

### 20. What are React fragments?  
**Answer**: React Fragments (`<></>` or `<React.Fragment>`) are used to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.  

---

### 21. What are class-based components in React?  
**Answer**:  
Class-based components are ES6 classes that extend the `React.Component` class. They must have a `render()` method that returns JSX. Class components can hold state and have access to React lifecycle methods, making them suitable for complex logic before the introduction of Hooks.  

---

### 22. What are React lifecycle methods?  
**Answer**:  
React lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that get called during the different phases of a component's life. These phases include:  
1. **Mounting** (when a component is added to the DOM)  
   - `constructor()`: Initializes state and binds methods.  
   - `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: Updates state based on props.  
   - `render()`: Returns JSX.  
   - `componentDidMount()`: Runs after the component is rendered. Ideal for API calls.  

2. **Updating** (when a component re-renders due to state/props changes)  
   - `static getDerivedStateFromProps()`: Updates state before re-rendering.  
   - `shouldComponentUpdate()`: Determines whether to re-render.  
   - `render()`: Updates the UI.  
   - `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`: Captures some information before the DOM updates.  
   - `componentDidUpdate()`: Runs after the DOM is updated.  

3. **Unmounting** (when a component is removed from the DOM)  
   - `componentWillUnmount()`: Clean up resources like timers or subscriptions.  

4. **Error Handling**  
   - `componentDidCatch()`: Handles errors in child components.  

---

### 23. What is the difference between functional and class components regarding lifecycle methods?  
**Answer**:  
Class components rely on specific lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, etc.), whereas functional components use the `useEffect` Hook to handle lifecycle events. `useEffect` consolidates many lifecycle tasks into one function, making functional components more concise.  

---

### 24. When would you use `componentDidMount()`?  
**Answer**:  
`componentDidMount()` is called once after the initial rendering of the component. It's commonly used for:  
- Fetching data from an API.  
- Adding event listeners.  
- Setting up subscriptions.  

---

### 25. What is `shouldComponentUpdate()` and when would you use it?  
**Answer**:  
`shouldComponentUpdate()` is a lifecycle method that determines whether a component should re-render when state or props change. It is used to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary renders. It returns a boolean (`true` to update, `false` to skip).  

---

### 26. What is `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`?  
**Answer**:  
`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` is called just before changes in the DOM are committed during the updating phase. It allows capturing information about the current DOM state (e.g., scroll position) before it is updated. The return value of this method is passed to `componentDidUpdate()`.  

---

### 27. What is `componentWillUnmount()`?  
**Answer**:  
`componentWillUnmount()` is called just before a component is removed from the DOM. It's used to clean up resources like:  
- Removing event listeners.  
- Cancelling API requests.  
- Clearing timers or intervals.  

---

### 28. Why is `componentWillMount()` deprecated?  
**Answer**:  
`componentWillMount()` was used to perform tasks before the component mounted, such as initializing state. However, it caused issues with asynchronous code and server-side rendering, so it was deprecated in favor of `constructor()` and `static getDerivedStateFromProps()` in React 16.3+.  

---

### 29. How do you initialize state in a class component?  
**Answer**:  
State is initialized in the `constructor()` method of a class component by assigning an object to `this.state`. For example:  
```javascript  
class MyComponent extends React.Component {  
  constructor(props) {  
    super(props);  
    this.state = { counter: 0 };  
  }  
}  
```  

---

### 30. How do you update state in a class component?  
**Answer**:  
State is updated using the `setState()` method, which schedules a re-render. Example:  
```javascript  
this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 });  
```  
State updates are asynchronous, so to base updates on the previous state, you can use a callback:  
```javascript  
this.setState((prevState) => ({ counter: prevState.counter + 1 }));  
```  

---

### 31. What is the purpose of the `constructor()` in class components?  
**Answer**:  
The `constructor()` is used to:  
- Initialize state.  
- Bind event handlers.  
- Access props by passing them to the `super()` method.  

Example:  
```javascript  
constructor(props) {  
  super(props);  
  this.state = { name: "React" };  
}  
```  

---

### 32. What is the difference between `componentDidMount()` and `componentWillUnmount()`?  
**Answer**:  
- **`componentDidMount()`**: Runs after the component is mounted and is used for setting up resources like API calls or event listeners.  
- **`componentWillUnmount()`**: Runs before the component is unmounted and is used for cleaning up resources like event listeners or timers.

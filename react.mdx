### 1. What is React?  
**Answer**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, making it easier to develop and maintain complex web applications. React was developed by Facebook and is widely used due to its efficiency and flexibility.  

---

### 2. What is a component in React?  
**Answer**: A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI in a React application. Components can be functional or class-based and can manage their own state. Components allow for modularity and help organize code, making it more readable and maintainable.  

---

### 3. What is the Virtual DOM?  
**Answer**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to optimize rendering. When a componentâ€™s state changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, then compares it with the actual DOM (using a process called "diffing"). React then updates only the parts of the actual DOM that have changed, which improves performance.  

---

### 4. What is state in React?  
**Answer**: State is an object in React components that holds data or information about the component. When the state of a component changes, React re-renders the component to reflect the new data. State is mutable and managed within the component.  

---

### 5. What are props in React?  
**Answer**: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable and allow components to be dynamic and reusable.  

---

### 6. What is Redux?  
**Answer**: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a centralized store for managing application state, making it easier to debug and predict state changes. Redux uses actions, reducers, and a store to handle state updates.  

---

### 7. What is Context API?  
**Answer**: The Context API is a React feature that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It's used for managing global state in React applications and is often an alternative to Redux for simpler state management needs.  

---

### 8. What is JSX in React?  
**Answer**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that resembles HTML. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it needs to be transpiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel.  

---

### 9. What is the difference between functional and class components in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **Functional Components**: JavaScript functions that return JSX. They use React Hooks for state and lifecycle management.  
- **Class Components**: ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`, with lifecycle methods and a `render` method for JSX.  

Functional components are preferred for their simplicity and performance benefits.  

---

### 10. What is `useEffect` in React?  
**Answer**: `useEffect` is a React Hook that allows functional components to perform side effects, such as fetching data or updating the DOM. It runs after the component renders and can be configured to run only when specific dependencies change.  

---

### 11. How do you optimize React app performance?  
**Answer**:  
- Use React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders of functional components.  
- Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values.  
- Split code using dynamic imports or lazy loading (`React.lazy`).  
- Avoid unnecessary state updates.  
- Use proper keys in lists for rendering.  

---

### 12. What is React Router?  
**Answer**: React Router is a library for handling navigation in React applications. It provides components like `BrowserRouter`, `Route`, `Switch`, and `Link` to create dynamic and single-page routing.  

---

### 13. What is the difference between `useCallback` and `useMemo`?  
**Answer**:  
- **`useCallback`**: Memoizes a function and returns the same instance unless its dependencies change.  
- **`useMemo`**: Memoizes the result of a computation and recalculates it only if its dependencies change.  

---

### 14. What is a Higher-Order Component (HOC)?  
**Answer**: A Higher-Order Component is a function that takes a component and returns a new enhanced component. HOCs are used for reusing logic and behavior between components.  

---

### 15. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **Controlled Components**: Components where form data is handled by React state. Example: `<input value={state} onChange={handleChange} />`  
- **Uncontrolled Components**: Components where form data is handled by the DOM. Example: `<input ref={inputRef} />`  

---

### 16. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in React?  
**Answer**:  
- **localStorage**: Data persists even after the browser is closed.  
- **sessionStorage**: Data persists only during the session and is cleared when the browser is closed.  

---

### 17. What is Next.js, and how is it different from React?  
**Answer**: Next.js is a React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and other advanced features out of the box. While React is a library for building UI, Next.js is used to build full-fledged React applications with routing, APIs, and performance optimizations.  

---

### 18. How do you handle forms in React?  
**Answer**:  
- Use controlled components with state to manage input values.  
- Use `onChange` handlers to update state.  
- Libraries like Formik or React Hook Form can simplify form handling and validation.  

---

### 19. What is React.memo?  
**Answer**: `React.memo` is a higher-order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components by memoizing them. It renders the component only if its props have changed.  

---

### 20. What are React fragments?  
**Answer**: React Fragments (`<></>` or `<React.Fragment>`) are used to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM.

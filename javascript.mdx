### 1. **Difference between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference**
   - **Pass by Value**: Creates a copy of the variable. Changes to the copy don’t affect the original value. Primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.) are passed this way.
   - **Pass by Reference**: Passes a reference to the same memory location. Changes affect the original object. Objects and arrays are passed this way.

---

### 2. **Difference between `map()` and `filter()`**
   - **`map()`**: Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array with the same length.
   - **`filter()`**: Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array with fewer elements.

---

---

### 5. **Difference between `for-in` and `for-of`**
   - **`for-in`**: Iterates over object keys (including inherited properties).

---

### 6. **Difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`**
   - **`call()`**: Invokes a function with arguments passed individually.
   - **`apply()`**: Invokes a function with arguments passed as an array.
   - **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with `this` set permanently.

     console.log(...arr); // 1, 2, 3
     ```

---

### 9. **Rest Operator (`...`)**
   - Collects multiple elements into a single array or object.  
     ```js
     const [a, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3]; 
     // a = 1, rest = [2, 3]
     ```

---

---

### 56. **What are JavaScript modules?**  
JavaScript modules allow you to break your code into smaller, reusable pieces. Modules use `export` to expose functionality and `import` to use it in other files.  
```js
// module.js
export const greet = () => console.log("Hello!");

// main.js
import { greet } from './module.js';
greet(); // Hello!
```

---

### 57. **What is immutability in JavaScript?**  
Immutability means an object’s state cannot be modified after it’s created. In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable, but techniques like `Object.freeze()` or libraries like Immutable.js can enforce immutability.

---

### 58. **Difference between setTimeout and setInterval**  
- **setTimeout**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.  
- **setInterval**: Executes a function repeatedly at specified intervals until canceled.  
```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("Executed once"), 1000); 
setInterval(() => console.log("Executed repeatedly"), 1000);
```

---

### 59. **How do you handle errors?**  
- Use `try...catch` blocks to handle runtime errors.  
- Use `.catch()` to handle promise rejections.  
- Implement proper error messages and logging.  
```js
try {
  const result = riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error occurred:", error);
}
```

---

### 60. **Difference between deep copy and shallow copy**  
- **Shallow Copy**: Copies only the first level of the object, leaving nested objects as references.  
- **Deep Copy**: Recursively copies all levels of the object.  
```js
// Shallow Copy
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: { c: 2 } };
const shallow = { ...obj1 };

// Deep Copy
const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj1));
```

---

### 61. **What is the typeof operator?**  
The `typeof` operator returns the type of a variable as a string.  
```js
console.log(typeof 42); // "number"
console.log(typeof "Hello"); // "string"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"
```

---

### 62. **What are template literals?**  
Template literals use backticks (``) for strings, allowing interpolation and multi-line strings.  
```js
const name = "Tarun";
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, Tarun!
```

---

### 63. **What are IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions)?**  
An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it’s defined.  
```js
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE executed!");
})();
```

---

### 64. **Explain destructuring assignment.**  
Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into variables.  
```js
const [a, b] = [1, 2]; // Array destructuring
const { name, age } = { name: "John", age: 30 }; // Object destructuring
```

---

### 65. **What is the spread/rest operator?**  
- **Spread**: Expands elements of an array or object.  
- **Rest**: Combines multiple elements into an array.  
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4]; // Spread

function sum(...numbers) { // Rest
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
```

---

### 66. **How does the new keyword work?**  
The `new` keyword creates an instance of an object using a constructor function.  
```js
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
const person = new Person("Tarun");
```

---

### 67. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous code**  
- **Synchronous**: Code executes line-by-line, blocking further execution until the current task completes.  
- **Asynchronous**: Tasks can run concurrently, and the main thread continues executing.  
```js
console.log("Start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("Async task"), 1000);
console.log("End");
```

---

### 68. **Difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies**  
- **localStorage**: Persistent storage, survives browser restarts.  
- **sessionStorage**: Temporary storage, cleared on tab close.  
- **Cookies**: Used for server communication, limited in size.  
```js
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```

---

### 69. **What is the Symbol type?**  
A `Symbol` is a unique and immutable primitive value often used as object keys.  
```js
const sym = Symbol("unique");
const obj = { [sym]: "value" };
```

---

### 70. **What are generators?**  
Generators are functions that can pause and resume execution using the `yield` keyword.  
```js
function* generator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}
const gen = generator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
```

---

### 71. **Function declaration vs. function expression**  
- **Declaration**: Hoisted, can be used before defining.  
- **Expression**: Not hoisted, defined within an expression.  
```js
function declaration() {} // Function Declaration
const expression = function () {}; // Function Expression
```

---

### 72. **How does JavaScript handle scope and scope chains?**  
JavaScript resolves variables by searching in the current scope and its parent scopes until it finds the variable or reaches the global scope.  

---

### 73. **What are default parameters?**  
Default parameters allow setting default values for function arguments.  
```js
function greet(name = "Guest") {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}
greet(); // Hello, Guest
```

---

### 74. **Difference between null and undefined**  
- **`null`**: An intentional absence of value.  
- **`undefined`**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned.  

---

### 75. **What are WeakMap and WeakSet?**  
- **WeakMap**: Holds key-value pairs where keys are weakly referenced objects.  
- **WeakSet**: Holds weakly referenced objects.  
```js
const wm = new WeakMap();
const ws = new WeakSet();
```

---

### 76. **Purpose of Object.freeze()**  
`Object.freeze()` makes an object immutable by preventing modifications to its properties.  
```js
const obj = Object.freeze({ key: "value" });
obj.key = "new value"; // Error or ignored
```

---

### 77. **Use of Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()**  
- `Object.keys()`: Returns property names.  
- `Object.values()`: Returns property values.  
- `Object.entries()`: Returns key-value pairs as arrays.  

---

### 78. **What is a polyfill?**  
A polyfill is code that provides modern functionality in older browsers that don’t natively support it.  

---

### 79. **How do Promise.all() and Promise.race() work?**  
- **`Promise.all()`**: Resolves when all promises are resolved, or rejects if any promise fails.  
- **`Promise.race()`**: Resolves/rejects as soon as the first promise resolves/rejects.  

---

### 80. **What is memoization?**  
Memoization is an optimization technique where the results of expensive function calls are cached for reuse.  
```js
const memoizedFn = (() => {
  const cache = {};
  return (key) => cache[key] || (cache[key] = expensiveFn(key));
})();
```

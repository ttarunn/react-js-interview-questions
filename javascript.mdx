### 1. **Difference between Pass by Value and Pass by Reference**
   - **Pass by Value**: Creates a copy of the variable. Changes to the copy don’t affect the original value. Primitive types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.) are passed this way.
   - **Pass by Reference**: Passes a reference to the same memory location. Changes affect the original object. Objects and arrays are passed this way.

---

### 2. **Difference between `map()` and `filter()`**
   - **`map()`**: Transforms each element of an array and returns a new array with the same length.
   - **`filter()`**: Filters elements based on a condition and returns a new array with fewer elements.

---

### 3. **Difference between `map()` and `forEach()`**
   - **`map()`**: Returns a new array and does not modify the original.
   - **`forEach()`**: Executes a function on each element but doesn’t return anything.

---

### 4. **Difference between Pure and Impure Functions**
   - **Pure Function**: Always produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
   - **Impure Function**: May produce different outputs for the same input or cause side effects (e.g., modifying external state).

---

### 5. **Difference between `for-in` and `for-of`**
   - **`for-in`**: Iterates over object keys (including inherited properties).
   - **`for-of`**: Iterates over iterable values (like arrays, strings, etc.).

---

### 6. **Difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`**
   - **`call()`**: Invokes a function with arguments passed individually.
   - **`apply()`**: Invokes a function with arguments passed as an array.
   - **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with `this` set permanently.

---

### 7. **Key Features of ES6**
   - Arrow functions, `let` and `const`, Template literals, Default parameters, Rest/Spread operators, Promises, Classes, Modules, Destructuring, Generators.

---

### 8. **Spread Operator (`...`)**
   - Expands an iterable (like arrays, objects) into individual elements.  
     ```js
     const arr = [1, 2, 3];
     console.log(...arr); // 1, 2, 3
     ```

---

### 9. **Rest Operator (`...`)**
   - Collects multiple elements into a single array or object.  
     ```js
     const [a, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3]; 
     // a = 1, rest = [2, 3]
     ```

---

   - Non-Primitive: `object`, `array`, `function`.

---

### 21. **Difference between TypeScript and JavaScript**
   - TypeScript is statically typed and supports interfaces. JavaScript is dynamically typed.

---

### 22. **Authentication vs Authorization**
   - **Authentication**: Verifies identity (e.g., login).
   - **Authorization**: Verifies permissions.

---

### 23. **Difference: `null` vs `undefined`**

   - **`undefined`**: Variable declared but not assigned a value.

---

### 24. **Output of `3+2+"7"`**
   - `"57"` (first addition, then string concatenation).

---

### 25. **`slice()` vs `splice()`**
   - **`slice()`**: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
   - **`splice()`**: Modifies the original array by adding/removing elements.

---

### 26. **Destructuring**

---

### 38. **Hoisting**
   - Variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope.

---

### 39. **Difference: `let`, `var`, `const`**
   - `var`: Function-scoped, can be redeclared.
   - `let`: Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared.
   - `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned.
